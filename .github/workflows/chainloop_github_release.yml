# Description: This workflow is used to record a release in Chainloop. It is triggered when a release is published on GitHub.
# It uses the Chainloop CLI to create an attestation for the release assets, source code and additional materials if provided.
# The attestation is then pushed to the Chainloop service and the attestation link is added to the release notes.
# Prior to running this workflow, the Chainloop workflow is onboarded if it does not exist.
# By default, the permission is contents:read to download the release assets. If you want the release notes
# to be updated with the attestation link, modify it to contents:write.
